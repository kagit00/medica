Healthcare Microservices Architecture: Patient, Doctor, Appointment, and Notification
Overview
This project demonstrates a microservices architecture for a healthcare system, consisting of four primary services: Patient Service, Doctor Service, Appointment Service, and Notification Service. These services interact with each other to handle patient appointments, doctor availability, and communication via notifications.

Services Overview:
Patient Service: Manages patient records, including personal details, medical history, and appointment requests.
Doctor Service: Manages doctor profiles, specialties, availability, and approval/rejection of appointments.
Appointment Service: Handles the creation, modification, and management of patient appointments.
Notification Service: Sends notifications to patients and doctors (e.g., appointment confirmation, approval, and reminders).
Flow:
Patient Service:
Receives patient appointment requests.
Notifies the Appointment Service for processing and availability check.
Appointment Service:
Sends appointment requests to Doctor Service for approval or rejection.
Sends status updates (approved, cancelled) back to Patient Service.
Notifies the Notification Service for communication with the patient and doctor.
Doctor Service:
Receives the appointment request from Appointment Service.
Approves or rejects the appointment based on availability.
Sends approval or rejection status back to Appointment Service.
Notification Service:
Sends notifications to the patient and doctor based on the appointment status (e.g., confirmation, reminder, or cancellation).
Services Communication
Synchronous communication via REST API (e.g., Appointment Service -> Patient Service for appointment status updates).
Asynchronous communication using Webhook or Event-based messaging for notifications and appointment approvals.
Technologies Used
Spring Boot for all services
Spring Cloud for service discovery, config management
RabbitMQ/Kafka for event-driven messaging (optional)
MySQL/PostgreSQL for database management
JWT for authentication and authorization
Docker for containerization
Kubernetes for orchestration (optional)
Running the Project
Prerequisites:
Docker and Docker Compose installed for containerization.
JDK 11+ for building the Spring Boot services.
RabbitMQ/Kafka running locally or on the cloud for messaging (optional).
MySQL/PostgreSQL database running locally or cloud.
Steps to run:
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/healthcare-appointment-microservices.git
cd healthcare-appointment-microservices
Build the services:

bash
Copy code
mvn clean install
Start the services using Docker Compose:

bash
Copy code
docker-compose up --build
This will start all microservices (Patient, Doctor, Appointment, Notification) in containers.

Access services:

Patient Service: http://localhost:8081
Doctor Service: http://localhost:8082
Appointment Service: http://localhost:8083
Notification Service: http://localhost:8084
Check the logs:

bash
Copy code
docker-compose logs -f
API Endpoints

Event Flow
Appointment Request:

Patient Service receives the patient's appointment request.
Appointment Service creates an appointment and sends it to Doctor Service for approval.
Doctor Service approves or rejects the appointment.
Appointment Service updates the patient with the status and triggers notifications.
Appointment Status Update:

If the doctor approves the appointment, Appointment Service updates the Patient Service.
Notification Service sends confirmation to the patient and doctor.
If the doctor rejects the appointment, Appointment Service updates the Patient Service and Notification Service sends a rejection message.
Notification:

Notification Service sends notifications based on appointment actions (confirmation, rejection, etc.) via SMS or email.
Future Enhancements:
Add payment gateway integration for appointment payments (e.g., Stripe, PayPal).
Implement availability slots for doctors to manage their time slots.
Add cancellation policy to handle patient-initiated appointment cancellations.
Enhance security with OAuth2/JWT for service-to-service authentication.
Implement monitoring and logging using Spring Actuator and ELK stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana).
